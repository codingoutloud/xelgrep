Grep (search) eXtended event log (`*.xel`) file

# `Microsoft.SqlServer.XEvent.Linq.dll`
The file `Microsoft.SqlServer.XEvent.Linq.dll` is needed by this project, but not included. This is simply because I don't have distribution rights. After an extensive (and fruitless) search of the web, I found this file in the GAC at this location on my Windows machine:

`C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\assembly\GAC_32\Microsoft.SqlServer.XEvent.Linq\v4.0_14.0.0.0__89845dcd8080cc91\Microsoft.SqlServer.XEvent.Linq.dll`
